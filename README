pngrim -- fixes white borders of PNG textures

Loads a PNG file and gets rid of the white border that shows up
if the PNG is used as a texture in OpenGL and scaled down.
Saves as 32 bit (RGBA) PNG files.

The "white border" problem is originally caused by OpenGL interpolating the
neighboring pixels of textures, causing color mixing of the affected pixels.
Graphics programs like photoshop tend to save erased and fully transparent
areas as plain white with zero alpha. When color mixing is performed,
this white shows up because it is mixed with the visible neighboring pixels
(in both alpha and color).

This program works similar to the "Solidify" filters by
Flaming Pear Software (http://flamingpear.com), but is less sophisticated,
faster, and much simpler to use:
Just invoke "./pngrim *.png" and have all PNGs in the current directory fixed.

It was a quick hack for me to fix white borders in game textures,
and is not inteded to be fancy.
There will be no visible change to the PNG, but the difference can be seen
if the alpha channel is removed.

The graphics included as an example were made by Frances Fawcett.
